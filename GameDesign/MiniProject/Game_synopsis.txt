This is a game about a studious monkey, who believes knowledge is power and has to over come the hurdles in his life(symbolized by the guns that shoots bullets/rocks) to gain the knowledge and be worthy of the power it possess which is placed at the end of the plane.

To Win :  
Reach at the end of the plane, the green area where table and chairs are placed.

You loose if you : 
1) Trip over the plane and vanish into the void.
2) Get hit by the rocks/bullets.

Tip: there's no time limit, but this doesn't mean you can stay in one place and be safe... the bullets can reach every spot in the plane, so KEEP MOVING!


Happy gaming, 
Cheers
